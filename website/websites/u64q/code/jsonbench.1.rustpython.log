PROGRAM FAILED 


PROGRAM OUTPUT:

encodings initialization failed. Only utf-8 encoding will be supported.
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'encodings'

The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:

RuntimeError: Could not import encodings. Is your RUSTPYTHONPATH set? If you don't have access to a consistent external environment (e.g. if you're embedding rustpython in another application), try enabling the freeze-stdlib feature
Traceback (most recent call last):
