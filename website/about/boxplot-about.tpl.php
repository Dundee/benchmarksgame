<p>The <b>direct comparison</b> between 2 programming language implementations will give you a better understanding of the differences in program performance than this summary page.</p>
<p>In some cases, a median score shown here is faster but the median time ratio shown in the direct comparison is slower. In those cases, the range of measurements for those 2 programming language implementations is really quite similar.</p>
<p>(Remember, the scores shown here have been weighted with the time taken by the fastest program for each task, written in <i>any of the programming languages</i> -- the direct comparison is based solely on measurements for the 2 programming language implementations.)</p>


<p>There are other ways to analyse and present this data: look for patterns in <a href="code-used-time-used-shapes.php">Code-used Time-used Shapes</a> or take the <a href="summarydata.php">Summary Data</a> and do your own analysis!</p>
